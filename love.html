    <h1>what is love ? </h1>
    <p>Love is a set of emotions and behaviors characterized by intimacy, passion, and commitment. It involves care, closeness, protectiveness, attraction, affection, and trust. Love can vary in intensity and can change over time. It is associated with a range of positive emotions, including happiness, excitement, life satisfaction, and euphoria, but it can also result in negative emotions such as jealousy and stress.1

        When it comes to love, some people would say it is one of the mozst important human emotions. Yet despite being one of the most studied behaviors, it is still the least understood. For example, researchers debate whether love is a biological or cultural phenomenon.2
        
        Love is most likely influenced by both biology and culture. Although hormones and biology are important, the way we express and experience love is also influenced by our personal conceptions of love.</p>

<h1>relationships now adays</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<p>To me relationships have always been a subject of understanding, research, reflection and thought. What I see is that these are very strange in every aspect whether it is personal or social. These are very hard to understand, but what I have seen is that a true and genuine relationship is very simple and straightforward. Because true relationships are free of expectations, they are pure love and bliss. Nothing is expected from you return, none of the worldly drama. Presence of this in life is magical, not even a word needs to be said as it is not formed out of any materialistic expectations. These type relationships are very rare and only few are lucky enough to have one.

    Most people are in relationships because of some expectations, they connect with others for wealth, power, or influence, it is only to gratify their personal self-interest. These relationships are missing the basic virtue of truthfulness and does not last very long. Relationships formed on agenda are destined to break, they will not last long. Some say the true relationships are the relationships of soul, but I hesitate to accept this philosophy, because the ones own have seen their soul or met their soul are just pure love and bliss, they don’t see others any different from them, and there are very few of this kind, 1 in millions.
    
    Basically, in true nature of creation we all are soul mates as we are created by the ONE, the ONE lives in all of us. But none of us understand this fact, none of us know this reality. The day you become aware of this; all your relationships would be formed out of love.
    
    What we see and have in our daily lives are the relationships that are hollow, we know that these are hollow but still carry them. I ask you why? What is stopping you from dropping this hollow off your head and walk freely? You need to look inside yourself and see, what fills you, nurtures you and completes you, what makes you who you are, the real you and drop the rest. Once you drop the dead weight, you would be able to fly. You have a choice either walk with dead weight over your head or fly without wings.
    
    These days friendships and courtships are mostly based on financial gains, the open secret investigation that goes on in the name of knowing each other makes me laugh. How can you know someone in few days, months, or years? We humans are ever changing, nothing is constant in this life. We all know the life spam of these type of relationships, that is why dating sites are on the boom. We need to bring sincerity of old days back into every relationships, the days when people left their homes unlocked, and we these days do not have the courage to leave our phones unlocked. And we call ourselves the generations of the brave, educated, elite and privileged, who want to conquer the world but have lost ourselves. We are the generation who is living in illusion, far from reality.
    
    When you love someone, love them for who they are, don’t be selective. I love your this and this, but I don’t love your that and that. This is not love because love is either all or none.
    
    Firstly, fall in love with yourselves before you try to love others, be real you and let other be who they are. The beauty of true relationships is embracing the uniqueness of others because we all are made unique.
    
    “When a relationship is all about profit, the heart will always be hollow!”

<h3><b><big>you are in love</big> </b></h3>
<p>People in the throes of falling in love often report feeling like they know more, or can do more, according to Theresa E. DiDonato, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Loyola University Maryland. She describes how an experience of “self-expansion” often occurs as people fall in love, meaning their own sense of self grows through their relationship with this new person. For example, someone whose partner loves hiking might start to see themselves as a hiker too.

    You’re ignoring other attractive people.
    Gone are the days of swiping right on dating apps or DM'ing other potential partners. If you realize you’re not as inclined to investigate those other fish in the sea, that can be telling, DiDonato tells Oprah Daily.
    
    “Falling in love may correspond with changes in attention–specifically people in loving, committed relationships show less attention to other viable partners,” she says.
    
    You feel the love everywhere.
    Finding yourself suddenly enjoying small chat with your less-than-pleasant coworker, or striking up conversations with your crabby neighbor? Your loved-up vibes could certainly be radiating beyond your partnership, notes Pomeranz. "Falling in love can knock us out of autopilot and allow us to see everything and everyone in a new light. Love can contribute to an increased sense of well-being and lead to a positive outlook, which can extend far beyond the person directly in front of us."
    
    You’re kind of freaking out.</p>
